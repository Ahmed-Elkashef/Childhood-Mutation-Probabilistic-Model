C -> Cases of cancer
H -> Hereditary cases of cancer
N -> Non-hereditary cases of cancer
t -> age at time of diagnosis
U -> Unilaterality
B -> Bilaterality

All cancer cases are referred to retinobalstoma.
If Hereditary or Non-hereditary cancer cases are collected according to age at diagnosis, according to Unilateral or Bilateral, then fraction of cases not diagnosed with a given age can be plotted as function of age.

HC(t) -> Hereditary cancer caces
HU(t) -> Hereditary unilateral cases
HB(t) -> Hereditary bilateral cases
N(t) -> Non-hereditary cases

For Hereditary cases -> m(t) is the mean number of tumors per individual initiated by a somatic mutation in interval [o,t]
Assumption for purpose of analysis: No delay between appearance of first cancer cell and time of diagnosis.

In Hereditary cases, expected number of tumors in one eye (righ or left) is m(t)/2.

Usage of Poisson distribution because it is more appropriate for small numbers of random events.

For retinoblastoma the mean number of tumors acquired by a hereditary case 'm(infinity)' is estimated to 3. However, the correct value could be 4 since errors in counting tend to make this estimate low.
